              <p className="p-6">In this assignment, I learned about the importance of organization and structuring of elements within a document. I had to take in mind how a reader reads and follows along a document. This means that the order and design of the instructions had to be careefully considered.</p>

              <p className="p-6">This assignment was about professionalism in the workplace, and was more relevant to applications and interviews. During the time of making this project, I embarked on my job hunt for my first internship. Thus, this project was a greate opportunity to learn about the importance of font-size and color within documents. And of course, I eventually got my first internship!</p>

              <h1 className="text-xl p-8">Project 3: Proposal</h1>
              <p className="p-6">This project was a group assignment that had us write written proposals given a certain topic. This would be the only group-based project in the entire course, thus the importance of teamwork was paramount. This meant that as a team, we had to communicate our ideas and execute them efficiently. In regards to the assignment, formatting and research was the most practiced skill that had us doing bibliographies and formatting documents.</p>
